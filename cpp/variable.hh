/// \brief A high-level variable modeled as a list of low-level variables, each written once
///
/// In the Static Single Assignment (SSA) representation of a function's data-flow, the Varnode
/// object represents a variable node. This is a \b low-level \b variable: it is written to
/// at most once, and there is 1 or more reads.  A \b high-level \b variable, in the source
/// language may be written to multiple times. We model this idea as a list of Varnode objects, where
/// a different Varnode holds the value of the variable for different parts of the code. The range(s)
/// of code for which a single Varnode holds the high-level variable's value is the \b cover or \b range
/// of that Varnode and is modeled by the class Cover.  Within a high-level variable, HighVariable,
/// the covers of member Varnode objects should not intersect, as that represents the variable holding
/// two or more different values at the same place in the code. The HighVariable inherits a cover
/// which is the union of the covers of its Varnodes.
